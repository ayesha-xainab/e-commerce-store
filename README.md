# E-commerce-store

I have built an E-commerce Store using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## About the Store

The name of the website is "Anime store", that sells Anime products to the fans. Products include notebooks, action figures, jewellery, key chains, etc.

## Features

- **Responsive Design:** The website is fully responsive and optimized for various devices and screen sizes using advanced CSS techniques like Flexbox and Grid.
- **Semantic HTML5:** The structure of the website is built using semantic HTML5 elements for better accessibility and SEO.
- **Product Image Gallery:** Users can view different product images by swiping left/right.
- **Add to Cart Functionality:** Users can add products to the cart, which updates dynamically with the selected product details.
- **Shopping bag Page:** Users can view their 'added to cart' products on a separate page, with the total amount and checkout options.

## Usage

- **Home Page:** Browse featured products and latest additions.
- **Product Page:** View detailed product information, switch between images, and add products to the cart.
- **Cart:** View cart summary, update quantities, and proceed to checkout.
